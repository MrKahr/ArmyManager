# Mini Collection Manager
A desktop application for tracking your collection of miniature figures.

## Features
- Customize every part of your figure!

## Folder Structure
The workspace contains three folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `designDocs`: the folder that contains design documents

The compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Known Bugs
- [ ] TBD

### IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
This application is developed by a single person, and is not associated with any wargames retailer. 

## Milestones completed
### HelloMini - (14/06/2024)
- [x]  System can instantiate figures
- [x]  Colors, varnish and base coats can be added to figures
- [x]  User can interact with a CLI that lists possible functions that can be called.
- [x]  User can see figure details in terminal for each figure in a single system.
### Jarhead (22/06/2024)
- [x] User can run batch script on windows to compile, create jar file and run application.
### FiguresGalore
- [x] System can build figure from parts
- [ ] System can validate figure reject invalid parts/parts already attached using appropriate design pattern (observer, chain of responsiblity)
- [x] System can divide figures into appropriate collections and subsystem
- [ ] System can update status of figure if figure is fully assemled, has primer on each layer, has primer on each layer etc.
### DocStringsGalore 
- [ ] System documents every non-setter and getter method in "Figures" package. 
- [ ] System documents purpose of app. 
- [x] Github is updated with purpose of the app, milestones, features (markdown instead of raw file).
### TestingFigures 
- [ ] System has unit tests for every and class combination (look at Gabriela's testing strategy)
- [ ] System displays unit test coverage
- [ ] System provides appropriate exceptions for all classes. 
- [ ] System system tests batch script
### Research figures
- [ ] Find the 5 most popular figure system 
- [ ] Check which categories they have/which elements are common to each category
- [ ] Update system classes to reflect these categories. 
### GettingInTheSwingOfThings  
- [ ] System can show simple UI of current collection (Java swing)
- [ ] System can navigate between systems in collection 
- [ ] System shows alert to user when figure is created
- [ ] Users can add and remove figures in UI 
- [ ] Users can select single figure 
- [ ] Users can see coats applied to figure represented as circles in UI
- [ ] Users can see figures 
### LightenUpItsJustModelling
