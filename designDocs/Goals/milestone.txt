** Milestones **
----------------
1 - HelloMini (14/06/2024)
Figures objects can be instantiated
Colors, varnish and base coats can be added to figures. 
User can interact with a CLI that lists possible functions that can be called. 
User can see figure details in terminal for each figure in a single system.

1.1 - Jarhead (22/06/2024)
User can run batch script on windows to compile, create jar file and run application. 

2 - FiguresGalore 
System can build figure from parts
System can validate figure with tree traversal/reject invalid parts/parts already attached using appropriate design pattern (factory pattern + observer + composite pattern + builderpattern?)
System can divide figures into appropriate collections and subsystem - DONE!
System keeps track of status of figure 

3 - DocStringsGalore 
System documents every non-setter and getter method in "Figures" package. 
System documents purpose of app. 
Github is updated with purpose of the app, milestones, planned features (markdown instead of raw file).

4 - TestingFigures 
System has unit tests for every and class combination (look at Gabriela's testing strategy)
System displays unit test coverage
System system tests batch script 

x - GettingInTheSwingOfThings  
System can show simple UI of current collection (Java swing)
System can navigate between systems in collection 
System shows alert to user when figure is created
Users can add and remove figures in UI 
Users can select single figure 
Users can see coats applied to figure represented as circles in UI
Users can see figures 

z - LightenUpItsJustModelling  
Ensure UML diagram matches v 0.2 of apllication. 

y - mumumultiprogramming! 


FEATURECREEP - IMPLEMENT AT YOUR OWN RISK!
TODO: Implement cloneable s.t. system may make shallow copies of figures - there may be multiple of the same figure type e.g. three elven archers
TODO: Add mutex to id generator
TODO: Implement uniformally distributed random number generator - time is not a secure way of generating ids
